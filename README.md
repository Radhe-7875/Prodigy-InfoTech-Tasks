Prodigy-InfoTech CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP


Overview of Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.

Invented by: Julius Caesar, who used it to encrypt military messages.
Key Principle: Simple rotation of the alphabet based on a shift value.
Benefits
Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement, even for beginners.
Fast Processing: Requires minimal computational power.
Educational Value: Serves as an introductory concept to cryptography.
Customization: Shift values provide a basic level of customization.
Advantages
Lightweight: Requires no complex computation or resources.
Customizable Key: The shift value serves as the "key," offering multiple variations.
Readable Output: The cipher text is still legible when decrypted with the correct shift.
Disadvantages
Low Security: Vulnerable to brute force (only 25 possible keys for English letters).
Alphabet Restriction: Limited to a single alphabet and case sensitivity without extensions.
Pattern Detection: Easily breakable with frequency analysis.
Uses of Caesar Cipher
Educational Purposes: Ideal for teaching the fundamentals of cryptography.
Puzzles and Games: Used in escape rooms or ciphers for fun activities.
Basic Obfuscation: Lightweight protection for non-critical text.
Historical Study: Understanding early cryptographic techniques.
